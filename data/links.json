Because there are no national animal welfare laws in China, dogs now have no legal rights.\n\nNo food animal status means no food-safety framework, no lawful slaughter rules, and no transport standards, resulting in a black market of stolen pets, back-alley killing, menu fraud, and trucks moving animals across the country in the dark.\n\nA superstitious belief that more pain means better meat, and no binding standards, leads to dogs boiled alive, blowtorched alive, skinned alive, and savagely beaten.\n\nShenzhen and Zhuhai banned it outright. The rest of the country hasn’t.\nSo dogs and cats now exist in a loophole: not approved as food, not banned everywhere, which means fewer protections and more suffering.\n\n\"It's their culture/tradition\" is a copout and ignorance talking. You wouldn't give a free pass to \"cultural/traditional\" child brides, slavery, or honor killings elsewhere.\nChina needs a national ban on slaughter, transport, sale, and advertising. Licenses pulled. Markets closed. Raids on supply lines. Public enforcement reports."

          "description": "This poor puppy is shut out day and night. Sometimes there's a crate, sometimes there isn't. He's had no protection from the recent storms in the area.\nUnder Texas Penal Code §42.092, this appears to meet the definition of:\n- Unreasonably failing to provide necessary shelter and care for an animal in one’s custody (§42.092(b)(3)); and\n- Confining an animal in a cruel manner (§42.092(b)(5)).\nThe owner claims they work 12-hour shifts and “has to” shut the puppy out or he will soil the house. And yet the puppy is shut out with no shelter, whilst the owner is home.\nAnimal services have been called, but aren't taking the situation seriously. Forecasts in Lewisville expect temperatures of 30°F next week, cold enough to cause severe illness or death if he's shut out without shelter.",

Someone lit that fire, and then they refused to give him up for treatment.\n@compton_paw_patrol pulled Luke out of the camp and got him to a vet.\n\nIf you're interested in being Luke's foster once he's out of the vet, DM @compton_paw_patrol\n\nAnd please consider donating to @compton_paw_patrol.

A 'man' known only as “David”, who tortured and killed a cat, then posted it to Instagram for entertainment. His page @churchofububal has since been deleted, but the YouTube channel under the same name remains active. He has now threatened to kill another animal on October 31. He is believed to be around 27, with a left-side neck tattoo, a Spider-Man tattoo on his right rib, and another on his right hand. This is mental illness.",
