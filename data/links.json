          "description": "On August 11th, 2025, India’s Supreme Court ordered all stray dogs in Delhi-NCR to be removed from public spaces and locked away in shelters, with no return to their home streets.\n\nEven though a later bench called that “too harsh” and talked about sterilise-vaccinate-return with designated feeding zones, the damage was done. People heard exactly what they wanted to hear: the dogs are the problem, and getting rid of them is acceptable.\n\nSince then, we’ve seen what that looks like on the ground.\nDogs beaten with sticks and iron rods.\nDogs rounded up and dumped in places with no food, water or shelter.\nA dog in Jaipur tied by the legs and thrown onto a live transformer, electrocuted to death while his caretaker screamed.\n\nThis is state-sanctioned cruelty by silence.\n\nIndia’s Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act still values a dog’s suffering at ₹10-50 ($0.11-0.56) for a first offence. Even repeat offenders can walk away with a token fine and a few months in jail, if that.\n\nTNVR, trap, neuter, vaccinate, return, works. It reduces bites. It controls rabies. It stabilises street dog populations. But killing, dumping and looking the other way is cheaper in the short term. Once again, money matters more than life.\n\nIndia loves to sell itself as the land of ahimsa, of compassion for all living beings. Right now, its streets tell a very different story.\n\nIndia’s tourism industry is projected to pump tens of billions into the economy in 2025. If the government and the courts want to ignore the blood on the pavements, then it’s time to hit them where it hurts most, their wallet.\n\nCancel the yoga retreats and tiger safaris.\nSkip the spiritual “bucket list” tours.\nChoose countries that actually enforce cruelty laws.\n\nUntil India stops turning its street dogs into punching bags and corpses, it does not deserve your money.",

Because there are no national animal welfare laws in China, dogs now have no legal rights.\n\nNo food animal status means no food-safety framework, no lawful slaughter rules, and no transport standards, resulting in a black market of stolen pets, back-alley killing, menu fraud, and trucks moving animals across the country in the dark.\n\nA superstitious belief that more pain means better meat, and no binding standards, leads to dogs boiled alive, blowtorched alive, skinned alive, and savagely beaten.\n\nShenzhen and Zhuhai banned it outright. The rest of the country hasn’t.\nSo dogs and cats now exist in a loophole: not approved as food, not banned everywhere, which means fewer protections and more suffering.\n\n\"It's their culture/tradition\" is a copout and ignorance talking. You wouldn't give a free pass to \"cultural/traditional\" child brides, slavery, or honor killings elsewhere.\nChina needs a national ban on slaughter, transport, sale, and advertising. Licenses pulled. Markets closed. Raids on supply lines. Public enforcement reports."

He's had no protection from the recent storms in the area.\nUnder Texas Penal Code §42.092, this appears to meet the definition of:\n- Unreasonably failing to provide necessary shelter and care for an animal in one’s custody (§42.092(b)(3)); and\n- Confining an animal in a cruel manner (§42.092(b)(5)).\nThe owner claims they work 12-hour shifts and “has to” shut the puppy out or he will soil the house. And yet the puppy is shut out with no shelter, whilst the owner is home.\nAnimal services have been called, but aren't taking the situation seriously. Forecasts in Lewisville expect temperatures of 30°F next week, cold enough to cause severe illness or death if he's shut out without shelter.",

Dogs don’t “accidentally” swan-dive into flames. Someone lit that fire, and then they refused to give him up for treatment.\n@compton_paw_patrol pulled Luke out of the camp and got him to a vet.\n\nIf you're interested in being Luke's foster once he's out of the vet, DM @compton_paw_patrol\n\nAnd please consider donating to @compton_paw_patrol. Vet treatment isn't cheap.\n\nThank you, @therealpaulmueller, for sharing his story.",
