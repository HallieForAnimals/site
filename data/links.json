          "description": "China removed dogs from the national livestock list in 2020. Because there are no national animal welfare laws in China, dogs now have no legal rights.\n\nNo food animal status means no food-safety framework, no lawful slaughter rules, and no transport standards, resulting in a black market of stolen pets, back-alley killing, menu fraud, and trucks moving animals across the country in the dark.\n\nA superstitious belief that more pain means better meat, and no binding standards, leads to dogs boiled alive, blowtorched alive, skinned alive, and savagely beaten.\n\nShenzhen and Zhuhai banned it outright. The rest of the country hasn’t.\nSo dogs and cats now exist in a loophole: not approved as food, not banned everywhere, which means fewer protections and more suffering.\n\n\"It's their culture/tradition\" is a copout and ignorance talking. You wouldn't give a free pass to \"cultural/traditional\" child brides, slavery, or honor killings elsewhere.\nChina needs a national ban on slaughter, transport, sale, and advertising. Licenses pulled. Markets closed. Raids on supply lines. Public enforcement reports.",

The other dog is still lying dead on Florence Ave. nearly a week later.\n\nPeople in the encampment are claiming Luke “got a fright and jumped into the fire.” Bullshit. Dogs don’t “accidentally” swan-dive into flames. Someone lit that fire, and then they refused to give him up for treatment.\n@compton_paw_patrol pulled Luke out of the camp and got him to a vet.\n\nIf you're interested in being Luke's foster once he's out of the vet, DM @compton_paw_patrol\n\nAnd please consider donating to @compton_paw_patrol. Vet treatment isn't cheap.\n\nThank you, @therealpaulmueller, for sharing his story.",
