If it isn’t, it needs to be initiated immediately.\n\nA direct quote from Denisse Gonzales' Facebook before she deleted her social accounts.\n\n\"Listen you nosy little people, if you don’t know what’s going on why don’t you shut up and go do something useful. The dog is mine, I rescued him from the street when he was little and I know it’s wrong to give alcohol to animals but don’t be idiots, the beer had less than half in it and obviously he didn’t drink it.\"\n\nShe basically admitted everything while trying to justify it.",
