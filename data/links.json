Any protections animals have are flimsy at best and nestled into other legislation, leaving plenty of wiggle room for loopholes to be exploited. Due to these exploits, dogs and cats are stolen from the streets to be slaughtered in deplorable conditions with no legal consequences. A ban on dog meat has been in effect in Hanoi since 2021, but there is no national ban yet, despite 64% of Vietnamese people supporting one.",
